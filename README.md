Problem Statement
Current social media platforms create undue social stress due to the emphasis on likes and followers, which prevents real connections. In addition, fleeting conversations prevent the development of meaningful relationships. There is a need for a solution that encourages authentic interactions, removes judgment criteria, and promotes consistent communication.

Setup:
All the dependencies are listed in package.json and can be installed using command:
First Termina
cd server
npm i 

Second Terminal
cd frontend
npm i


You are all ready to go!!
